STMicroelectronics STPMU1 Voltage regulators

Regulator Nodes are optional depending on regulators you want to connect to
your SoC

Available Regulators in STPMU1 device are:
  - buck1 for Buck BUCK1
  - buck2 for Buck BUCK2
  - buck3 for Buck BUCK3
  - buck4 for Buck BUCK4
  - ldo1 for LDO LDO1
  - ldo2 for LDO LDO2
  - ldo3 for LDO LDO3
  - ldo4 for LDO LDO4
  - ldo5 for LDO LDO5
  - ldo6 for LDO LDO6
  - vref_ddr for LDO Vref DDR
  - boost for Buck BOOST
  - vbus_otg for VBUS_OTG switch
  - sw_out for SW_OUT switch

Switches are fixed voltage regulators with only enable/disable capability.

Optional properties:
- Any optional property defined in bindings/regulator/regulator.txt
- st,mask_rank: enable masking of rank during Reset for particular regulator
- st,mask_reset: stay on during Reset for particular regulator
- regulator-pull-down: enable high pull down
  if not specified light pull down is used
- st,regulator-boot-off: switch off the regulator during kernel start-up
- regulator-over-current-protection:
    if set, all regulators are switched off in case of over-current detection
    on this regulator,
    if not set, pmic driver generates an interruption when over-current is
    detected. The regulator is kept on.
- <regulator>-supply: phandle to the parent supply/regulator node
	each regulator supply can be described except vref_ddr.

Example:
regulators {
	compatible = "st,stpmu1-regulators";

	ldo6-supply = <&v3v3>;

	vdd_core: regulator@0 {
		regulator-compatible = "buck1";
		regulator-name = "vdd_core";
		st,mask_rank;
		st,mask_reset;
		regulator-pull-down;
		st,pulldown_config = <2>;
		st,regulator-boot-off;
		regulator-min-microvolt = <700000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
		regulator-state-mem {
			regulator-on-in-suspend;
			regulator-suspend-microvolt = <700000>;
		};
		regulator-state-disk {
			regulator-off-in-suspend;
		};
	};

	v3v3: buck4 {
		regulator-compatible = "buck4";
		regulator-name = "v3v3";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;

		regulator-state-mem {
			regulator-suspend-microvolt = <3300000>;
			regulator-on-in-suspend;
		};
		regulator-state-disk {
			regulator-off-in-suspend;
		};
	};

	v1v8: ldo6 {
		regulator-compatible = "ldo6";
		regulator-name = "v1v8";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1800000>;
		regulator-over-current-protection;

		regulator-state-mem {
			regulator-off-in-suspend;
		};
		regulator-state-disk {
			regulator-off-in-suspend;
		};
	};


};
