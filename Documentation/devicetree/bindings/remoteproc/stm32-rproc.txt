STMicroelectronics STM32 Remoteproc
-----------------------------------

The STM32MP family use a MCU arm Cortex M

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "st,stm32-m4-rproc"
- reg: should contain the address ranges for the two internal
  memory regions, RETRAM and SRAM
- reg-names: contains the corresponding names for the two memory
  regions. these should be named "retram" & "mcusram".
- resets: reference to a reset controller asserting the MCU.
- reset-names: must be "mcu_rst"
- st,hold_boot: system configuration register which holds the mcu in reset
	1st cell: phandle to syscon block
	2nd cell: register offset of BOOT_MCU
	3rd cell: mask for BOOT_MCU bit

Optional properties:
- st,smc_boot: defined if the hold boot must be done by secure monitor
  call the smc with st,hold_boot parameters
- interrupts: should contain the watchdog interrupt
- interrupt-names: must be "wdg"

Example:
	m4_rproc: m4 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-m4-rproc";
		reg = <0x38000000 0x10000>,
		      <0x10000000 0x40000>;
		reg-names = "retram", "mcusram";
		resets = <&rcc MCU_R>;
		reset-names = "mcu_rst";
		st,hold_boot = <&rcc 0x10C 0x1>;
	};
