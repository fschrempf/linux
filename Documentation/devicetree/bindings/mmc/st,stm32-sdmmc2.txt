* STMicroelectronics STM32 SDMMC2 controller

The highspeed MMC host controller on STM32 soc family
provides an interface for MMC, SD and SDIO types of memory cards.

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties used by the sdmmc2 driver.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "st,stm32-sdmmc2"
 - reg: mmc controller base registers
 - interrupts: Should contain the interrupt number
 - clocks: Should contain phandle for the clock feeding the controller
 - resets: Should contain phandle for the reset feeding the controller

Optional property:
- st,idma: defines the idma mode
   0: idma disabled, pio mode (default, if no property)
   1: idma single buffer
   2: idma double buffer
- st,dirpol: for voltage tranceiver:
  by default IOs driven as output when direction signal is low
  but use it, if Voltage transceiver IOs driven as output when
  direction signal is high
- st,negedge: generate data & command on sdmmc clock falling edge

Example:
	sdmmc1: sdmmc@0x58005000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-sdmmc2";
		reg = <0x58005000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 49 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		clocks = <&rcc SDMMC1_K>;
		resets = <&rcc SDMMC1_R>;
		st,idma = <1>;
		bus-width = <4>;
		cap-sd-highspeed;
		cap-mmc-highspeed;
		status = "disabled";
	};
