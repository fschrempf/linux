* STMicroelectronics STM32 IPCC (Inter-Processor Communication Controller)

A mailbox is used to exchange messages between two processors.
The IPCC block provides a non blocking signaling mechanism to post and
retrieve messages in an atomic way.
The IPCC block provides the signaling for 2*N buffers. N buffers in the
direction from processor 0 to processor 1, and N buffers in the opposite
direction. This allows i.e. N different message types in each direction.
The mailbox buffers have to be located in a common memory, which is not part
of the IPCC block.
Number of buffers per processor (N) is defined in IPCC register.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,stm32-ipcc"
- reg: Offset and length of the device's register set
- clocks: The input clock of the IPCC instance
- interrupts: Interrupt specifiers for ipcc, one for each
  entry in interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names: 2 interrupt lines per processor
  rx buffer occupied => "rx?"
  tx buffer free (ack) => "tx?"
  2 processors per ipcc, where "?" is the processor index expressed
  as one digit "0" or "1".
- #mbox-cells: Must be 2
  <&phandle proc buf_id>
   phandle: Label name of controller
   proc: Index of your processor O or 1
   buf_id: Each processor buffer index (O to N)

Optional properties:
- wakeup-source: Flag to indicate this device can wake system (suspend/resume).
- interrupt-names : Name associated with interrupt line. Should be "wakeup?" if
  interrupt is to be used to wake system. 2 processors per ipcc, where "?"
  is the processor index expressed as one digit "0" or "1".

Example:
	ipcc: mailbox@4c001000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-ipcc";
		#mbox-cells = <2>;
		reg = <0x4c001000 0x400>;
		interrupts-extended = <&intc GIC_SPI 100 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
				      <&intc GIC_SPI 101 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
				      <&intc GIC_SPI 103 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
				      <&intc GIC_SPI 104 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
				      <&aiec 62 1>, <&aiec 61 1>;
		interrupt-names = "rx0", "tx0", "rx1", "tx1",
				  "wakeup0", "wakeup1";
		clocks = <&rcc_clk IPCC>;
		wakeup-source;
		status = "disable";
	}

Client:
	mbox_test1: mailbox_test@1 {
		compatible = "mailbox-test";
		mboxes = <&ipcc 0 0>, <&ipcc 1 0>;
		mbox-names = "tx", "rx";
	};
