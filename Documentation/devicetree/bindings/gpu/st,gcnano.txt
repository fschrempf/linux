VeriSilicon gcnano GPU integration into STMicroelectronics platform

- gcnano: VeriSilicon gcnano GPU ip
  Required properties:
  - compatible: "st,gcnano"
  - reg:
        Physical base address of the ip registers and length of memory mapped
        region.
  - contiguous-area:
        Reserved memory region (contiguous memory region) used by
        the VeriSilicon software stack (minimum is 32MB, recommended is greater
        than 192MB). The size of the contiguous area depends on the display
        resolution, the color depth.
  - interrupts:
        gcnano interrupt for the 3D pipeline
  - interrupt-names:
        names of the interrupts listed in interrupts property in
  - clocks:
        clocks to be managed by the driver
  - clock-names:
        names of the clocks listed by clocks property in the same order
  - resets:
        reset signal of the gcnano IP
  - status:
        either "okay" or "disabled"

Device node example:

/ {
	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		gcnano_reserved: gpu@f8000000 {
			reg = <0xf8000000 0x8000000>;
			no-map;
		};
	};

	soc {

		...

		gcnano: gcnano@59000000 {
			compatible = "st,gcnano";
			reg = <0x59000000 0x800>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 109 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
			interrupt-names = "irq_3d";
			clocks = <&rcc_clk GPU>, <&rcc_clk GPU_K>;
			clock-names = "clk_3d_ahb" ,"clk_3d_clk2x";
			resets = <&rcc_rst GPU_R>;
			status = "disable";
		};

		...

	};
};
