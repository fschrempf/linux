STMicroelectronics STM32 USB HS PHY controller

The STM32 USBPHYC block contains a dual port High Speed UTMI+ PHY
USB2_2PHY_40lp50A and a UTMI switch.
It controls PHY configuration and status, and the UTMI+ switch that selects
either OTG or HOST controller for the second PHY port. It also sets PLL
configuration.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "st,stm32mp1-usbphyc"
- reg: address and length of the usb phy control register set
- clocks: phandle + clock specifier for the PLL phy clock

Optional properties:
- assigned-clocks: phandle + clock specifier for the PLL phy clock
- assigned-clock-parents: the PLL phy clock parent
- resets: phandle + reset specifier
- st,port2-switch-to-host: select HOST controller on UTMI switch for port#2


Example:
		usbphyc: usbphyc@5a006000 {
			compatible = "st,stm32mp1-usbphyc";
			reg = <0x5a006000 0x1000>;
			clocks = <&rcc_clk USBPHY_K>;
			resets = <&rcc_rst USBPHY_R>;
			st,port2-switch-to-host;
		};
