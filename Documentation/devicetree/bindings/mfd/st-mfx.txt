STMicroelectronics Multi-Function eXpander

ST Multi-Function eXpander (MFX) is a slave controller using I2C for
communication with the main MCU. Its main features are gpio expansion, main
MCU IDD measurement (IDD is the amount of current that flows through VDD)
and resistive touchscreen controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "st,mfx"
- reg: I2C address of the device
- interrupts: interrupt triggered by MFX_IRQ_OUT signal
- interrupt-parent: interrupt controller MFX is connected to

Optional nodes:

* GPIO eXpander
MFX provides 16 programmable GPIOs, and it is also possible to recover 8
alternate GPIOs if the main functions are not used (touchscreen controller and
IDD measurement not enabled).

Required properties:
- compatible : must be "st,mfx-gpio"
- gpio-controller: marks the device node as a GPIO controller
- #gpio-cells: should be <2>, the first cell is the GPIO offset on this GPIO
  controller, the second cell is the gpio flags in accordance with
  <dt-bindings/gpio/st-mfx-gpio.h>.

Example:

	mfx: mfx@42 {
		compatible = "st,mfx";
		reg = <0x42>;
		interrupts = <8 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpioi>;

		mfxgpio: mfx_gpio {
			compatible = "st,mfx-gpio";
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
		};
	};
